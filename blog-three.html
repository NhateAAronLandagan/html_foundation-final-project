            <h2>Comprehending Web Framework</h2>

        <h3>What is a Web Framework?</h3>

        <p><strong>A Web Framework (WF)</strong> or <strong>Web Application Framework (WAF)</strong> is a software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources, and web APIs. Web frameworks provide a standard way to build and deploy web applications on the World Wide Web.</p>

        <p>Web frameworks aim to automate the overhead associated with common activities performed in web development. For example, many web frameworks provide libraries for database access, templating frameworks, and session management, and they often promote code reuse. Although they often target development of dynamic web sites, they are also applicable to static websites.</p>

        <p>A <strong>framework</strong> is a structured platform that provides a foundation for developing applications. In software development, frameworks offer a set of tools, libraries, and guidelines that simplify the development process by abstracting common functionalities.</p>

        <h3>Why use Web Framework?</h3>

        <p>The framework enables developers to work efficiently on any project (although it is not mandated to use a framework, itâ€™s just a simple add-on feature) so that developers can achieve their goals smoothly, It also enables developers to work on any programming language (complex ones) easily. By using a framework, you can easily integrate almost anything by using its built-in <a href="https://www.guru99.com/what-is-api.html" target="_blank">APIs</a>
        </p>

        <h3>Frontend vs Backend</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>The <strong>frontend</strong> of a web application is the part you see and interact with. It consists of the web design and the interaction of the site. In terms of programming languages, this is almost always comprised of the CSS, HTML, and JavaScript of the page.</li><br>

            <li>The <strong>backend</strong> consists of the server, the database, and the code that interacts with them. This also consists of the code that gives dynamic data to the frontend of the site. This can be handled in most programming languages.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Frontend Frameworks</h3>

        <p><b>Frontend frameworks</b> are pre-written collections of standardized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that developers use to build web applications or websites more efficiently. They provide tools, libraries, and conventions for building user interfaces, handling events, managing application states, and interacting with APIs. </p>
        
        <ol type="1">

            <li><strong>Vue.js</strong></li>
            <li><strong>React</strong></li>
            <li><strong>AngularJS</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Tailwind CSS</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Ember</strong></li>

        </ol>

        <h3>Backend Frameworks</h3>

        <p><b>Backend frameworks</b> are essential tools that provide pre-built components and functionality for developing the server-side logic of web applications. They handle tasks like database interaction, user authentication, and request handling, making the development process more efficient and streamlined. </p>
        
        <ol type="1">

            <li><strong>Django</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Laravel</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Flask</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Meteor</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Express</strong></li>

        </ol>

        <p>Frontend and Backend technologies are both essential components of software development. The frontend is responsible for creating a user-friendly interface, while the backend manages the underlying server, application, and database infrastructure.
        </p>

        <p>Ultimately, both frontend and backend technologies require a deep understanding and expertise to develop and integrate effectively. By prioritizing the strengths and weaknesses of each technology, developers can create software applications that are functional, user-friendly, and successful in achieving their intended purpose.
